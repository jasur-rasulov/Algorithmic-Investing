# Best Model vs Benchmark

* Our best model so far is an Ensemble model built on top of machine learning algorithms
  * Let’s compare it to the benchmark (S&P 500) in terms of 
      * Average returns by year 
      * Cumulative returns across 40 years assuming that $1,000 was invested in 1976

# Final Returns: Conclusions

* In conclusion…
  * Ensemble Model that was constructed based on four data mining models, which were built on 16 variables from three different investing approaches:
    * Is outperforming standalone models from three different approaches in terms of **all metrics**
    * Is outperforming the S&P 500 by **16.4% on average** across 40 years
    * Beating the S&P 500 in **37** out of **40** back testing years
    * Percent of Profitable Years: **90.24%** vs **75.61%** for S&P 500
    * Downsides during financial crisis are not as bad as S&P 500:
      * 2007: **-9.2%** vs **-14.86%**
      * 2008: **-19.4%** vs **-28.2%**
