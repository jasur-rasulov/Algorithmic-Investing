# About Data Used In This Project

Data used in this project is considered **'Gold Standard'**.

Wharton Business School Provides Certain Academic Users Access To

* **CRSP** (Center for Research in Security Prices) – Comprehensive returns for stocks

* **Compustat** – Metrics from annual and quarterly reports

We marry these to test investment strategies over multi-year period

CRSP & Compustat are cost prohibitive for an individual investor

* But other data sources are reasonably priced for an individual investor
