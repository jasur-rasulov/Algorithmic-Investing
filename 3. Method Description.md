# Background & Introduction

What if...

* I told you that a college student in Chicago and his excellent professor 
  * Were interested in testing / discovering quantitative investing strategies
  * Using massive datasets, software, data mining, and previously researched investment principles
  * And after months of experimenting, found a strategy that…
    * Turned $1,000 invested in 1976 into $6,035,637 by 2016
    * With an average annual return of 25.40% vs. 9% for S&P 500
  * Interested? I think so. Let me tell you more. 

## Three Different Approaches for Picking Metrics to Evaluate Stocks

* **Fundamental Analysis**
  * Uses financial statement metrics to select stocks
  * We emulate the [ERP5 Method](https://www.quant-investing.com/blogs/general/2018/10/22/how-and-why-to-implement-the-erp5-investment-strategy-in-your-portfolio) (details to come)

* **Momentum Investing**
  * Past winning stocks tend to continue to win; losers continue to lose
  * We follow guidelines from the book [Quantitative Momentum](https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Momentum-Practitioners-Momentum-Based-Selection/dp/111923719X)

* **Use of Applied Statistics / Data Science in Investing**
  * To extract the most useful information from massive datasets, we will use a dimensionality reduction technique called Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

## ERP5

* Ranks companies by the following four variables to find companies with consistent earnings power for which the shares are trading at a considerable margin of safety
  * Earnings Yield
  * Price to Book
  * Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)
  * 5 Year Average ROIC 

* The sum of these individual rankings gives “ERP5 Score” for the company
* Companies with lowest ERP5 scores are most attractive

## Quantitative Momentum

* Basic premise: past winners tend to be future winners, and past losers tend to be future losers

* Described in the book Quantitative Momentum – A Practitioner’s Guide to Building a Momentum-Based Stock Selection System

* Variables used by Quantitative Momentum strategy
  * Generic Momentum Measure – Total Return of Stock over a period, skipping the last month
  * Frog-in-the-Pan – Separates high momentum stocks into those that have more continuous price paths versus more discrete price paths (i.e. jumpy)

## Principal Components Analysis

* Statistical method used for dimensionality reduction
  * Converts possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components

* Particular dataset from Wharton Research Data Services contains 170+ ratios
  * Through PCA, we found that 10 principal components capture about 80% of the variance
  * We selected the most important 10 variables from those components
