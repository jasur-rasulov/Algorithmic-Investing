# Methodology

* We explored two different strategies
  * First method: giving equal weights to all 16 variables
  * Alternatively, we tested machine learning models to assign different weights based on results of
    * Linear Regression
    * Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
    * Neural Network
    * Ensemble Modeling 
* Previous year’s coefficients from 16 independent variables were used to score next year’s target variable (annual return)

## Ensemble Modeling
  * Ensemble modeling refers to using multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance
    * In our scenario, we will be using the predictions we obtained from models built on 16 independent variables as independent variables and rebuild machine learning models
  * The following is a visual representation of our Ensemble Model:
