# Risk Measures

* The following table provides a list of metrics we will use to evaluate risk of our portfolio

| Metric | Why Important? |
| ------ | -------------- |
| Standard Deviation | Volatility |
| Upside Deviation | Uncertain Possibility of Gain |
| Downside Deviation | Downside Risk of Returns Below a Threshold (0% in our example) |
| Sharpe Ratio | Measur of Risk-Adjusted Return |
| Sortino Ratio | Variation of Sharpe Ratio That Only Factors in the Downside Deviation |
| Percent of Profitable Years | Measures the profitability aross a given period |

# Portfolio Evaluation

## What if...

* What if we didn’t combine three approaches we initially described?
  * Let's separately compare the returns from
    * ERP5 (Fundamental Analysis)
    * Quantitative Momentum (Momentum)
    * PCA (Applied Statistics)
    
| - | CAGR | Standard Deviation | Downside Deviation | Upside Deviation | Percent of Profitable Years | Sharpe Ratio | Sortino Ratio |
| - | ---- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| ERP5 | **20.86%** | 22.30% | **6.37%** | **19.71%** | **83.72%** | **0.7** | **2.44** |
| Momentum | 16.79% | **19%** | 10.44% | 13.85% | 82.93% | 0.61 | 1.11 |
| PCA | 18.24% | 19.72% | 7.37% | 17.25% | 82.93% | 0.66 | 1.77 |

* This is not bad! But, can we do better?
  ```diff 
  + Yes! 
  ```
  * Let’s take a look at the combined approach with its machine learning variations

## Portfolio Evaluation (Enhanced Models)

* During every year from 1976 to 2016:
  * Top 5% of stocks according to the independent variable of the respective model were selected

| - | CAGR | Standard Deviation | Downside Deviation | Upside Deviation | Percent of Profitable Years | Sharpe Ratio | Sortino Ratio |
| - | ---- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Equal Weights | 19.32% | **19.88%** | 8.14% | 16.66% | 85.37% | 0.71 | 1.73 |
| Regression | 18.51% | 25.44% | 8.24% | **19.94%** | 80.49% | 0.52 | 1.62 |
| MARS | 22.80% | 23.68% | 10.79% | 18.20% | 80.49% | 0.74 | 1.63 |
| Neural Net | 17.75% | 24.71% | 9.18% | 17.74% | 78.05% | 0.51 | 1.37 |
| Ensemble | **25.40%** | 21.62% | 5.72% | 18.81% | **90.24%** | **0.93** | **3.35** |
| S&P 500 | 8.99% | 16.28% | 5.20% | 13.90 | 75.61% | 0.23 | 0.73 |
| T-Bill | 5.20% | 3.57% |  | 3.57% | 87.80% |  |  |
